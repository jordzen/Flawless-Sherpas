# **Flawless Sherpas**

## **Site Overview**

The Flawless Sherpas website is designed for players of the video game destiny 2, where they can seek out assistance in the most competitve game mode in the game - Trials Of Osiris. Where only a very small percentage of players will go "flawless", the flawless sherpas offer their services to take people though the struggle of the game mode and take them flawless! The businesses main platform is on discord and so this is linked in all three pages on the website, making it easy to find and access.

Users of the website will be able to find all the information they need, being - who the flawless sherpas are, how the service works and the price of the service. there is also a video on how the service works, making it an extra visual learning form for the user. A screen shot of some reviews also backs up the quality of the service. There is also a sign up form for users that do not have discord, so that the website can reach all of the targeted audience.

## _Wireframes_

To put ideas into reality and play around with how the website will work and look, i started using wireframes to plan out the website layout and content. This would also help me avoid scope creep.
Below are the wireframes for the 3 intended pages for mobile and desktop.
