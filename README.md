# **Flawless Sherpas**

## **Site Overview**

The Flawless Sherpas website is designed for players of the video game Destiny 2, where they can seek out assistance in the most competitive game mode in the game - Trials Of Osiris. Where only a very small percentage of players will go "flawless", the flawless sherpas offer their services to take people through the struggle of the game mode and make them flawless! The business's main platform is on Discord and so this is linked in all three pages on the website, making it easy to find and access.

Users of the website will be able to find all the information they need, including - who the flawless sherpas are, how the service works, and the price of the service. there is also a video on how the service works, making it an extra visual learning form for the user. A screenshot of some reviews also backs up the quality of the service. There is also a signup form for users who do not have Discord so that the website can reach all of the targeted audience.

## **Planning**

### **Target Audience**

- Users that play the game Destiny 2
- Users that play Destiny 2 and struggle to get the desired loot in the game mode "trials of Osiris"
- Users who want to improve as players by looking for tips and advice from successful gamers

### **User Questioning**

- Users want a brief description of how the service works and an easy to find a link to the discord
- Users want to know what the service costs
- Users that don't have Discord want a way to sign up for the service
- Users want to see reviews to feel confident in the service
- Users want to see a video of the discord and how to navigate it

### **Websites Aim**

- Provide information about what the business offers, cost of service, and easy access to the business's main working platform - discord
- Ensure the user can navigate easily around the page, to find what they want
- Ensure information is short and to the point making it easy to digest for the user
- Provide the user with both written explanation and visual explanations of how the service works
- Provide a contact point for people without discord to maximize customers for the business
- Provide the business with more exposure to potential customers
- Be designed to create a positive user experience on all devices, including mobile and up to desktop.

### **How Will This Be Achieved**

- The site will contain a navbar in the header, where users can navigate easily to the different pages of the site
  being -

- The home page - which will provide a summary of what the website is and what the business provides, which will
  be located at the start of the page. This page will summarise who the business is, what they do, and the cost of the service. Also, a link
  to the discord server will be provided.
- The How It Works page - which will provide a more detailed explanation about the steps to follow, to use the service.
  This will be both written and visual explanations in the form of bullet points and a YouTube video. There will also be a reviews section and a
  second link to the discord server.
- The signup page - which will provide users that do not have discord or have any other questions, a form to fill out, so the business can
  contact them and discuss how to help them. This page will also have a link to the discord server. The form must have feedback to the user that they have submitted their form.

- The website will be a responsive design for different devices, starting from mobile and up to desktop.

## **Wireframes**

To put ideas into reality and play around with how the website would work and look, I started using wireframes to plan out the website layout and content. This would also help me avoid scope creep.
Below are the wireframes for the 3 intended pages for desktop.

![Home page wireframe for desktop](docs/screenshots/home-page-wireframe-desktop.png)

![How it works wireframe for desktop](docs/screenshots/how-it-works-wireframe.png)

![Sign up wireframe for desktop](docs/screenshots/sign-up-wireframe.png)

I started the wireframe design for desktop in this project and would have started for mobile and then done desktop if I were to do it again, as I coded for mobile design first and then added the response design after.

There were also some changes to the final design being -

- I did not include an embedded scrollable reviews page, as after researching this with Discord, I found that I needed to use a bot and Python, which was out of my scope at the time. Instead, I added 3 screenshots of reviews and will replace this will a scrollable page in the future.
- I added text to the signup form, of why it is there and for whom, for clarity.
- I changed the hero images to be more relevant to the content and look better when on wider screens.
- I added cover text to hero images, for more effect and positive emotional response from users.
- I added box-shadow effects to the hero images, header, and sign-up form, to stand out more.
- I also had to adjust the layout for mobile users, including a burger bar button for a drop-down menu of the navbar.
- I changed the color of the how it works button and red list headers, for accessibility reasons.

## **Features**

#### **Navigation:**

- The navigation buttons appear on the header, on all 4 pages, including the form feedback page, making it an easy way to navigate throughout the website and allowing the user to find what they want fast.
- The nav buttons include the About page, how it Works page, and the signup page.
- The nav buttons are all colored differently, on a grey header, to make them easy to spot.
- They also have relevant icons for better aesthetic design and better UX.
- The nav buttons have a hover feature, giving the user feedback when they hover over each of the nav buttons showing them they can select the page.
- The buttons also show the user which page they are on, by an underline of the page's button.
- The nav bar becomes a drop-down menu for mobile users by using a burger bar.

---

#### **Header**

- The header sticks to the top of all pages on the website and so as the user scrolls up and down, the header will remain fixed and move with the flow of the page. This creates a good UX as the user can find the navigation bar easily and at all times.
- It includes the title of the page, which also acts as an internal link to the home page - about.
- It also homes the navigation buttons which are located in the bottom right-hand side of the header, and for mobile users, this will turn into a dropdown menu in the form of a burger bar found on the right-hand side of the header.
- It has a black solid border with a box shadow effect to stand out.

![Header](docs/screenshots/header.png) ![mobile header](docs/screenshots/mobile-header.png)

## **About Page**

The About page first contains a hero image, being of in-game cosmetics of the game mode the site is about. It has a brief description of the purpose of the website and what the business is offering, which is also seen by the user immediately on the site open. It is summed up in one line and made big and is in the centre of the page. It is styled in the yellow color of the game mode and is next to the game mode logo.
It also contains,

- 3 bullet-pointed lists, all with colored headers, matching the color order of the navigation bars. The information provided is what is most important to the user and is summed up in an easy-digested list, getting straight to the point. This is, who we are, what we offer, and the price.
- It also includes a link to the business's main platform, discord, with an icon of the Discord logo and text for the user to select to take them to the website, which will open in a new tab. The link has a hover feature, where the color of the text of the link will change to green, when the user hovers over it, showing them they can click it - green being a positive color.

![About Page 2](docs/screenshots/about-page2.png)

## **How It Works Page**

The How It Works page contains an explanation of how the service works and steps to take to navigate the business operating platform - discord, summarised in short bullet-point lists. Following the same consistent style of 3 lists, with the same color headers as the previous page and nav buttons, each with a relevant icon.
It also contains,

- An embedded YouTube video, explaining how the service works, that can be played by selecting the play button and can be full screened for a better viewing experience. This adds an extra way for users to receive the information, that some people may find easier to digest.
- 3 screenshots of reviews from the business discord server, showing that the service holds value and is worth doing. This was originally meant to be a scrollable page of the entire review section of Discord, but ended up being out of my scope at the time and will be updated in the future.
- It has another hero image of the game mode the website is about.
- It also contains a second link to the discord server.

![How it works page 3](docs/screenshots/how-it-works-page3.png)
![How it works page 4](docs/screenshots/how-it-works-page4.png)

## **Sign Up Page**

The Signup page has a form to collect details from users who want to use the service but don't have Discord or have any other questions.
It also has,

- A submit button for the form, which has a hover feature that turns the button green when the mouse hovers over it - Green is a positive color.
- The form cannot be submitted until the required information is put in the input boxes - text and email.
- A link to the Discord server
- an explanation that you can still use the service without discord, by filling out the form.
- A form feedback page, that you are taken to on completion and submission of the form. This is a placeholder and will be updated in the future. It confirms to the user that they have completed the form correctly and are told that they will be contacted soon.
- A color scheme that matches the hero image creating an aesthetically pleasing page.
- The form has a box shadow effect that makes it stand out.

### **Form Feedback Page**

![Form feedback page](docs/screenshots/form-feedback.png)

## **Footer**

The footer contains 3 links that open in a different browser, these being, the business's Twitter page, YouTube page, and Facebook page.
They are evenly spaced along the header using a spacing of 20% each. The footer appears on all pages and allows the user to do more research and contact the business.

## **Testing**

## **During Devlopment Testing**

- During the development stages, I would regularly test each element for appearance and responsiveness via a simulated live server using an extension in Code anywhere.
- I published the page to GitHub pages and let people in the business discord review and test the site, using different devices and browsers. All feedback was positive.
- I tested the site myself, using different browsers: Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, to ensure the site works well on different browsers.
- To test the responsiveness of the site, I used devtools to simulate different screen sizes, to make sure the design of the site is fit for all devices. I then would add media queries in the style.css file to improve the responsive design.
- I have made sure all links on the site will open in a new browser.
- I have confirmed that on completion of the form and submission, the form feedback page will then appear.
- I have tested and made sure that the form cannot be submitted unless all relevant, required data is put in the correct boxes - text for names and email for email addresses.
- I have tested that all hover features for links work.
- I have made sure the embedded video works and also doesn't play automatically when the page loads. It requires the user to select play first.

## **Bugs, Issues And Fixes**

To see how the site worked and if any bugs or issues were present, I deployed it in the early stage of development through GitHub pages, as it can respond differently to the Code anywhere live server.

The issues I found during development include -

**_Burger bar location:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - the drop-down menu burger bar, for the navigation bar, would not move to the right-hand side of the header, no matter what I did. I wanted the two headers in rows and the nav bar on the right.

- **_Solution_**
  - I had to set the header display to flex and justify-content as space between. I had the headers wrapped in an anchor element and the nav bar in a nav element. From there I used padding to move the burger bar and title to where I wanted.

  **_Youtube video:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - The YouTube video I put in the How It Works page was not working, with the url I copied from the browser.

- **_Solution_**
  - I googled the issue and found I had the use the unique link on the videos page to embed the video into the site.

  **_Scrollable reviews page:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - When trying to embed a scrollable reviews page from the business's discord, every time I tried to do this I found that the website would load up a scrollable page of the discords join page, not the reviews page.

- **_Solution_**
  - I researched a way around this and found that the only way to display the page that I want is to use a bot and Python language. As this was out of my scope at the time, I decided to use screenshots of the reviews page and will update it to the scrollable page in the future.

  **_List structure readability:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - I originally had the 3 lists on the first two pages in column form for all screen sizes. However, I found that when on mobile, the lists would appear squashed and difficult to read. This creates a bad user experience.

- **_Solution_**
  - I changed the list layout to appear in rows on smaller screens and then changed to columns on larger screens using media queries. This made the content easier to read as it allowed me to increase font size.

  **_Hero image:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - the first hero image I added would load multiple copies of itself to fill the space on the screen. This didn't look good and I wanted just one large image across the full width.

- **_Solution_**
  - I set the image width to 100% and added no-repeat to the image style rule. This resulted in one wide picture of the hero image.

  **_Footer Icons:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - I spent some time trying to space the icons in the footer evenly with padding for different screen sizes and wasted a lot of time.

- **_Solution_**
  - By setting the footers display to flex and justify-content space between, this made sure the icons would appear evenly separated on every screen size. I played around with the padding with pixels but then found if I used percentage, it would result in consistent spacing across all screen sizes, saving time working out padding for each screen size using pixels.

  **_Link to other sites:_**

- **_Issue_**
  - When I first embedded a link to Discord, it would open in the same browser, taking me out of the website. This results in a poor user experience.

- **_Solution_**
  - I added the rule in the anchor element, target=\_blank. This resulted in the link opening up in a different browser when clicked.

**_Git commits issue:_**

Another issue I found was that during the early stages of development, I would forget, or not be as consistent with my git commits. This resulted in my commits containing too many various changes and so difficult, to sum up in a message. As the development went on I improved on this, making it easier to understand what had changed, if I had to go back and do bug finding or fixes. I also adjusted my commit messages from the past tense to the imperative tense.

### **Remaining bugs and issues**

- During the lighthouse test of the How it Works page, a note was flagged up linked to the embedded youtube video. This noted that - Pages that use Media Device Dispatcher are not eligible for back/forward cache and that it was pending browser support.
- Also, another point was flagged linked to the video and images - Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy.

As I have not yet learned about caches, a code institute tutor explained - that this is not covered and is an advanced topic that you would learn in your developer career rather than on a coding course. I would like to revise this in the future and fix the issue.

## **Post Development Testing**

### **Validators**

#### **_Html -_** <https://validator.w3.org/n>

- **_Issue_**
  - The navigation buttons I used were originally inside of an anchor element, which the validator displayed as a problem.
- **_Solution_**

  - I wrapped the buttons in separate form elements, which fixed the issue.

- **_Issue_**
  - I used a less-than-sign in the HTML code for a text paragraph, which caused several errors.
- **_solution_**

  - I changed the sign in the HTML to text code, which I found on Google, which displays the sign on the deployed site.

- **_Issue_**
  - I used line breaks in the HTML code, to add space between the list bullet points. This created errors in the code validator.
- **_Solution_**

  - I removed the line breaks in the HTML and added padding to the lists in the style sheet.

- **_Issue_**
  - Not enough header elements on the page.
- **_Solution_**
  - Added extra header elements to sections that were missing them, and where i didn't want them to show on the site, I set their display to none.

#### **_CSS -_** <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

- All pages passed the CSS code validator with no errors or issues found.

## **_Lighthouse scores_**

The two areas I had to work on to receive these scores were,

- color contrast - to improve the accessibility, I adjusted the color brightness of the blue and green headers on the pages and changed the color of the red headers to yellow.
- Image file size - The load times for the page were slower than could have been initially, and so to improve the performance of the site, I used a third-party website to optimize the images as much as I could. I was able to reduce the image file sizes by an average of around 75% which bumped up the site's performance score.

## **_Deployment_**

I deployed the site on GitHub pages, following these steps -

- In the project's repository in Github, go to the Settings tab.
- Select the Pages tab, from the left-hand side.
- Under the Source section, select the Main branch from the drop-down menu and click Save.
- From this, the page will provide a link to the live website.
