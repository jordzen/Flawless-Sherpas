# **Flawless Sherpas**

## **Site Overview**

The Flawless Sherpas website is designed for players of the video game destiny 2, where they can seek out assistance in the most competitve game mode in the game - Trials Of Osiris. Where only a very small percentage of players will go "flawless", the flawless sherpas offer their services to take people though the struggle of the game mode and take them flawless! The businesses main platform is on discord and so this is linked in all three pages on the website, making it easy to find and access.

Users of the website will be able to find all the information they need, being - who the flawless sherpas are, how the service works and the price of the service. there is also a video on how the service works, making it an extra visual learning form for the user. A screen shot of some reviews also backs up the quality of the service. There is also a sign up form for users that do not have discord, so that the website can reach all of the targeted audience.

### **Websites Aim**

### **How Will This Be Achieved**

- The site will contain a navbar in the header, where users can navigate easily to the different pages of the site
  being -

- The home page - which will provide a breif sumamry of what the website is and what the business provides, which will
  be located at the start of the page. This page will sumarise who the business is, what they do and the cost of the service. Also, a link
  to the discord server will be provided.
- the How It Works page - which will provide a more detailed explanation about the steps to follow, to use the service.
  This will be both written and visual explantion in the form of bullet points and youtube video. There will also be a reviews section and a
  second link to the discord server.
- The sign up page - which will provide users that do not have discord or have any other questions, a form to fill out, so the business can
  contact them and discuss how to help them. This page will also have a link to the discord server. The form must have feedback to the user that they have submitted their form.

  - The website will be a responsive design for different devices, starting from mobile and up to desktop.

## _Wireframes_

To put ideas into reality and play around with how the website will work and look, i started using wireframes to plan out the website layout and content. This would also help me avoid scope creep.
Below are the wireframes for the 3 intended pages for desktop.

![Sign up wireframe for desktop](docs/screenshots/sign-up-wireframe.png)

I started the wireframe design for desktop in this project and would have started for mobile and then done desktop if i was to do it again, as i coded for mobile design first and then added the response design after.  

There was also some changes to the final design being -

- I did not include an embeded scrollable reviews page, as doing rearch on doing this with discord, i found that i needed to use a bot and python, which was out of my scope at the time. Instead i added 3 screenshots of reviews and will replace this will a scrollable page in the future.  
- I added text to the sign up form, of why it is there and for who, for clarity.
- I changed 2 of the hero images to be more relevent to the content.
- I added cover text to hero images.
- I added box-shadow effects to the hero images, header and sign up form, to stand out more.
- I also had to adjust the layout for mobile users, including a burger bar button for a drop down menu of the navbar.
